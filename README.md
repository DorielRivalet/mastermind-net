#Mastermind

This project is implementing known Mastermind algorithms and evaluating them in order to build best Mastermind game solver possible.
Rules of Mastermind game are well described on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm)
Language choosed is multiplatform C# (.NET Core). Mastermind variants choosen to benchmark on are classic Mastermind(4, 6) - 4 pegs, 6 colors - and Deluxe Mastermind.
Benchmarked values are mean rounds to solution, worst case of rounds to solution, mean and pessimistic time to solution.

### Knuth 5 guess algo

Classic method from [Knuth 1976 paper "Computer as Mastermind"](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf) that started all this.

[C++ implementation](https://github.com/nattydredd/Mastermind-Five-Guess-Algorithm)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm)

Parallelized version was also implemented to improve performance.

### Swaszek
Swaszek (1999-2000) gives an analysis of practical strategies that do not require complicated record-keeping or use of a computer. Making a random guess from the set of remaining candidate code sequences gives a surprisingly short average game length of 4.638, while interpreting each guess as a number and using the next higher number consistent with the known information gives a game of average length 4.758. 

A simple strategy which is good and computationally much faster than Knuth's is the following (I have programmed both)
Create the list 1111,...,6666 of all candidate secret codes
Start with 1122.
Repeat the following 2 steps:

* 1) After you got the answer (number of red and number of white pegs) eliminate from the list of candidates all codes that would not have produced the same answer if they were the secret code.

* 2) Pick the first element in the list and use it as new guess.

This averages no more than 5 guesses.
